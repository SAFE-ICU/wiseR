Description: wiseR is a Shiny application for learning Bayesian network structure, inference and decision-making. It can be used for probabilistic reasoning (in the observational setting), causal inference (in the interventional setting) and policy decisions (in Decision Network setting). Functionalities include end-to-end implementations for data-preprocessing, structure-learning, exact inference, approximate inference, extending the learned structure to Decision Networks and policy optimization. Statistically rigorous methods including bootstraps, ensemble structure, cross-validation, resampling statistics are included. In addition to Bayesian Decision Networks, it also features correlation networks, community-detection, graph visualizations, cytoscape export and web-deployment of the learned models as Shiny dashboards.
